# TwitchPress Ultimate-Member Extension

TwitchPress Ultimate-Member is an extension for the TwitchPress system. The system begins with my Channel Solution for Twitch plugin. That plugin must be installed first. You can also install this extension using the Setup Wizard in the core plugin.

Currently requires the sync extension to be installed. The sync extension will be merged into the core soon though.
